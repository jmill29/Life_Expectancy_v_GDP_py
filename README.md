# Does GDP affect Life Expectancy?

The purpose of this project is to analyze the effect GDP has on life expectancy. To do so, this project will utilize various Python functions, as well as certain Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy and SciPy), to load and manipulate a dataset - consisting of GDP and life expectancy data for six countries (Zimbabwe, United States, Mexico, Chile, China, and Germany) over the course of 15 years - into a more manageable format, and then calculate numerous statistics regarding that data. The data will then be organized into various charts and graphs using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. Finally, these various statistics and data visualizations will be used to answer the following questions:

- Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations?
- Has GDP increased over time in the six nations?
- Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?
- If one country has a higher GDP than another country, is that country also likely to have a longer life expectancy?
- What is the average life expectancy in these nations?
- What is the average GDP of these six countries?
- What is the distribution of that life expectancy?
- What is the distribution of GDP among the six countries?
